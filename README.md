# PyTorch101

## PyTorch Basics

 -Understand Tensors and autograd

 -Build a simple feedforward network using torch.nn

 -Train and test your first model using MNIST or CIFAR-10

 -Learn about optimizers (SGD, Adam) and loss functions (CrossEntropyLoss, MSELoss)


 ## Deep Learning Architectures

 -Build and train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

 -Understand pooling, stride, and kernel size

 -Visualize learned filters and feature maps

 ## Model Optimization

  -Apply regularization (Dropout, L2 weight decay)

  -Experiment with different weight initialization methods

  -Use learning rate schedulers and batch normalization

## Transfer Learning & Autoencoders

   -Fine-tune pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG)

   -Implement simple autoencoders and visualize reconstructed outputs
